			"Fraud Detection in Privacy Preserving Health Insurance System using Blockchain Technology",
		paperLink: "https://doi.org/10.1002/eng2.70315",
		abstract: "In developed countries, around 90% of the population is covered by health insurance through public or private providers. However, fraudulent activities account for an estimated 3%–10% of total healthcare expenditures, resulting in financial losses exceeding $300 billion annually. These fraudulent practices erode trust among patients, healthcare providers, and insurers, further complicating the insurance claim process. Additionally, claim rejection rates due to fraudulent activities are estimated to range between 25% and 35%, which impacts its efficiency and trustworthiness and weakens the industry's reliability. The digitization of healthcare and the health insurance industry has amplified the need for robust and trustworthy systems that ensure data security and optimize the insurance claim process. To address these issues, this paper proposes a system that ensures patient anonymity through secure credentials and advanced fraud detection mechanisms. Privacy is preserved using cryptographic techniques such as secure hashing and anonymous credentials, which ensure that sensitive patient information remains confidential throughout the claim process. Smart contract algorithms are utilized in two scenarios: patient-submitted claims and healthcare provider-submitted claims, ensuring accurate processing and validation while detecting fraudulent activities such as duplicate claims, inflated medical bills, billing for unprovided services, falsifying patient records, and submitting claims for nonexistent treatments. The proposed system has been implemented and tested on a blockchain platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving privacy and detecting fraud. Performance evaluations reveal its scalability and efficiency in managing increased user loads, offering a robust solution to modern health insurance challenges while fostering trust and operational efficiency among participants.",

		abstract:
			"The healthcare sector faces significant challenges in securely managing and storing patient data. This paper introduces a Blockchain-based Medical Record Storage System (BMRS), which provides a decentralized and secure framework for healthcare data management. Utilizing blockchain’s decentralization and immutability, BMRS offers a robust solution for storing and sharing sensitive medical data. In this model, patients have full control over their medical records and can grant or revoke access to other stakeholders. Healthcare professionals gain secure, real-time access to patient information, improving diagnosis and treatment, while insurance providers benefit from enhanced data integrity and reduced fraud through tamper-proof records. Each medical interaction is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, creating a secure and unalterable record of patient history. Key features include cryptographic access control, compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR, and smart contracts to automate data access. The system has been implemented and evaluated based on security, scalability, and transparency, demonstrating its potential to enhance privacy, trust, and collaboration in healthcare.",

		month_year: "July 2024.",
		abstract:
			"Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) in Air Handling Units (AHUs) are vital for ensuring optimal indoor air quality and operational efficiency in hospital buildings. AHUs play a critical role in regulating temperature and humidity, which directly impacts patient care and staff comfort. Effective FDD can prevent system malfunctions that lead to increased energy consumption, higher operational costs, and potential health risks due to poor air quality. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques for FDD in hospital HVAC systems. Utilizing comprehensive datasets from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), we focused on various classifiers, including Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, which achieved accuracies of 99.85% and 99.77%, respectively, in fault identification. These models demonstrated exceptional precision, highlighting their suitability for complex environments where accurate diagnostics are essential. Our findings emphasize the importance of integrating machine learning into building management systems. By enabling early fault detection, these advanced models significantly reduce operational costs and enhance system reliability. This approach not only improves indoor air quality but also supports sustainable healthcare environments by minimizing energy waste. The research contributes to the development of smarter, more efficient building management solutions, paving the way for real-world applications of data-driven FDD methods. The insights gained provide a strong foundation for future implementations, promoting safer and more sustainable healthcare facilities through enhanced HVAC system performance and fault management. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in revolutionizing building management and improving the overall hospital environment.",

			"Storage and Maintenance of Sensitive Data using Homomorphic Encryption",
		publisher:
			"16th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN), Jaipur, India",
		month_year: "Nov 2023",
		abstract:
			"In today's data-driven world, the storage and maintenance of sensitive information present significant challenges related to privacy and security. Traditional encryption methods provide a robust solution for data protection at rest and in transit. While these encryption techniques are highly effective at ensuring the confidentiality of data at rest and in transit, they present challenges when performing operations on the encrypted data without decrypting it first. This limitation has significant implications for various applications, especially when privacy and security are paramount, raising concerns about data confidentiality during processing. Homomorphic encryption is a groundbreaking cryptographic technique that addresses this limitation by allowing computations on encrypted data without decryption. This paper examines the foundational principles of homomorphic encryption, its mathematical underpinnings, and its applicability in real-world scenarios. The paper also discusses the practical implementation of homomorphic encryption in sensitive data such as academic student records, including its impact on data storage infrastructure key management, emphasizing its role in protecting data privacy, enabling secure data outsourcing, highlighting how it empowers organizations to harness the value of their data without compromising security. By encrypting sensitive data using homomorphic encryption, we achieve a dual goal: data remains confidential even in a breach, and authorized users can perform computations directly on encrypted data, eliminating the need for decryption and minimizing privacy risks.",

		title: "Blockchain Based Smart Card for Smart City",
		publisher:
			"16th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN), Jaipur, India",
		month_year: "Nov 2023",
		abstract:
			"We are living in the age of various modern technologies and Blockchain is one of the newest among them. Smart contract are used with Blockchain as an add on which brings automation in application. Smart card are also used nowadays widely to access smart services in various domains. Since the vast majority of people nowadays do not want to carry a lot of cards with them at all times. As a result, we came up with a solution to this conundrum. A single Card, which will function as the key card for all municipal services, will serve as the core hub for all of this decentralization. Also planned is the development of a Cryptocurrency wallet, which will allow smart cities to access anything inside the Blockchain Network directly from peer to peer. There will be no intermediates who will be able to access any citizen’s information or data; yet, if an event happens, such as criminal activity, there will be no one to blame. Using blockchain technology, law enforcement will be able to follow down the perpetrators of these crimes since all timestamps will be saved on our platform. Because of this, smart cities will be less prone to criminal activity in general. We can ensure a more efficient smart city by using blockchain technology. Therefore, people will have a greater sense of security at every level of service where Card will play a vital part. Finally, we can say that a Blockchain-based Smart Card will serve as a one-stop solution for all of humanity. Consequently, we don’t have to be worried with all of the services that are offered in any certain place. Life will be far better than it has ever been in the past. Blockchain technology, which was initially introduced in 2008 and is based on cryptography, is the fundamental technology that underpins the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Initially, it was exclusively utilized by the cryptocurrency bitcoin.",
