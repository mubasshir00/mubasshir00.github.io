		duration: "2022 Dec - July 2024",
		description: [
			"As Co-Founder and CTO, I was responsible for designing, developing, and deploying the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Gaming Hub — a cloud-based game streaming platform focused on delivering real-time, low-latency gameplay. I translated the initial product vision into a functional prototype, selecting the appropriate tech stack, designing the backend architecture, and building the frontend interface. This included user authentication, session handling, stream management, and integration of video delivery protocols. The MVP served as the foundation for pilot testing, investor demos, and early user feedback.",
			"I implemented WebRTC-based video streaming functionality to support real-time gameplay broadcasting with minimal latency. This involved setting up signaling servers using Socket.io, configuring STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal, and optimizing stream quality using adaptive bitrate logic. I also developed a lightweight viewer interface that allowed users to watch live streams without delay, incorporating stream pause/play, resolution switching, and viewer chat integration — all with minimal overhead to the browser.",
			"I architected the MVP with modularity in mind — separating concerns such as stream handling, user sessions, analytics, and chat into distinct services. This approach allowed for isolated testing, easier debugging, and future microservices migration. I also configured a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker to automate testing, builds, and deployments to staging environments. Performance profiling tools were used to benchmark latency and memory usage, ensuring the app could support concurrent streaming sessions without degradation.",
