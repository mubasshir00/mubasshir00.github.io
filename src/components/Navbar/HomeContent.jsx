			<h2>Hello, I'm Mubasshir Ahmed</h2>
			<p>
				I am a software engineer and
				researcher from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I enjoy working with technology,
				building real-world solutions, and learning new things every day.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at ERI Ltd. I lead the
				backend team for a system called RTIS, which is used by more than 90
				factories across Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and other countries. Along
				with that, I have also worked on projects like an employee management
				system and live streaming platforms. I love writing clean code and
				solving difficult problems with smart solutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am also doing research at the Institute for Advanced Research. My work
				is focused on data privacy, cryptography, and using blockchain to
				protect patient data in the healthcare system. I have published several
				research papers in international conferences and journals. These topics
				are very close to my heart because I believe technology should also help
				people stay safe and secure.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past, I have worked with different startups and teams, building
				web applications using technologies like Node.js, Express, React, and
				MongoDB. I have experience in full-stack development, cloud services
				like AWS, Docker, and also writing automated tests to make sure
				everything works smoothly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apart from work and research, I enjoy taking part in hackathons and tech
				competitions. I was proud to be a winner and global nominee in the NASA
				Space Apps Challenge 2023, and I have also been a finalist in other
				events like Imagine Cup and HackNSU. These experiences taught me the
				value of teamwork, time management, and thinking creatively under
				pressure.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am passionate about technology, especially in areas like
				cybersecurity, machine learning, and blockchain. I believe in continuous
				learning and always try to improve myself — one line of code at a time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to explore my work,
				publications, or get in touch if you’d like to collaborate!
