			<h2>Hello, I'm Mubasshir Ahmed</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I’m Mubasshir Ahmed — a software engineer and researcher from Dhaka,
				Bangladesh. I enjoy building useful tools, solving real-world problems
				with code, and exploring new ideas through research.
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now, I’m working at Engineering Resources International (ERI) Ltd,
				where I lead the backend development for a system called RTIS, used by
				90+ factories in different countries. I’ve also co-founded a game
				streaming platform called Gaming Hub and taught cybersecurity courses
				for professionals.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m also doing research at the Institute for Advanced Research. My work
				focuses on protecting sensitive healthcare data using blockchain and
				encryption. I’ve written a few papers on this topic and presented them
				at international conferences.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy learning, building, and sharing. Whether it's a research idea, a
				software project, or a collaboration — I’m always interested in doing
				meaningful work with great people.
			</p>
			<p>Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
