			<h2>Hello, I'm Mubasshir Ahmed</h2>
			<p>
				I’m a software engineer and researcher passionate about cybersecurity, data privacy, blockchain, and machine learning. I’m currently working as a <b>Research Assistant</b> at the Institute for Advanced Research (IAR), United International University, where I focus on developing privacy-preserving systems using cryptography and blockchain to secure sensitive healthcare and insurance data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Professionally, I’ve had the opportunity to work on impactful projects across industries. At Engineering Resources International (ERI) Ltd., I led the backend development team for the Resources Tracking Information System (RTIS), a platform now used by over 90 factories and global clothing brands. I also spearheaded the development of an Employee Management System from the ground up. Alongside this, I co-founded Gaming Hub, a game streaming platform, and previously contributed to software development at Apprise IT, Vision Mash, and BDEMR Solutions Corp.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University, where my thesis explored the use of homomorphic encryption for secure data storage. My research has led to several publications in international journals and conferences, covering areas such as fraud detection in health insurance systems, blockchain-based healthcare data management, and machine learning for hospital infrastructure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond coding and research, I’ve enjoyed teaching as a lab instructor, where I delivered a cybersecurity program for IT professionals in banks and financial institutions. I also thrive in competitive environments — I was a Winner & Global Nominee of NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023, a Microsoft Imagine Cup finalist, and a multi-time hackathon runner-up.
			</p>
			<p>
				My technical toolkit spans backend and full-stack development, cloud technologies, DevOps, and modern cryptography. I’m deeply motivated to build secure, scalable, and future-ready technologies while continuing to explore areas like IoT, software engineering, and applied AI.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to explore my work,
				publications, or get in touch if you’d like to collaborate!
